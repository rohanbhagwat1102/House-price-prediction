# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of rooms, location, and other property-related attributes. Using regression-based machine learning techniques, the project provides a robust model that can help estimate real estate prices more accurately.

## 📌 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key drivers of house prices.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
- Train multiple regression models and compare their performance.
- Visualize feature importance and model predictions.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

## 📈 Workflow
1. Load and inspect the dataset  
2. Clean and preprocess data  
3. Visualize relationships (e.g., price vs. area, number of bedrooms, etc.)  
4. Train and evaluate regression models  
5. Interpret predictions and feature importance

## 📊 Key Findings
- House area and number of bedrooms are strong indicators of price.
- Linear regression performed well, but ensemble methods like Random Forest offered better accuracy.
- Proper feature engineering significantly improved prediction performance.
